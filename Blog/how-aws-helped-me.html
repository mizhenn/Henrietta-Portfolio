        <h2>How AWS Helped Me Get My Website Live and Why It’s So Cool</h2>
        <p>When I first started learning Fullstack development, I was amazed by how a few lines of code could bring a website to life. I remember thinking, “Wow, I just made something interactive on the web – this is so cool!” But then came the real questions: How does my website actually go live? How will it store all my images? What if the website gets a lot of traffic? These were the things that started popping up in my mind, and that's when I discovered the true power of AWS.</p>

        <p>As I began diving deeper into Fullstack development, I realized that making a website interactive and visually appealing was just the beginning. It’s easy to overlook the behind-the-scenes magic that happens when a site goes live, especially when it comes to handling traffic, storage, and ensuring everything runs smoothly. That's where cloud services like AWS came into play, and my entire perspective shifted.</p>

        <h3>The Magic of Getting a Website Live with AWS</h3>
        <p>When I finished coding my website, I thought the job was done. But then, I realized that I needed to figure out how to actually make the website available for everyone to visit. That’s when Amazon Web Services (AWS) came in, and it made the process so much easier.</p>

        <h3>Hosting My Website with Amazon S3</h3>
        <p>The first thing I needed was a place to put my website online. That’s when I found Amazon S3. S3 is a cloud storage service where you can upload your website files (like HTML, CSS, images, etc.) and make them accessible to the world.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Create an S3 bucket (a container for storing files).</li>
          <li>Upload my website files (images, HTML, CSS).</li>
          <li>Set the bucket to allow public access, meaning anyone could visit my website.</li>
          <li>Get a special web address (URL) that let people access my site.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In just a few steps, my website was live! It was exciting to see something I created online.</p>

        <h3>Speeding Up My Website with AWS CloudFront</h3>
        <p>Now that my site was live, I started to think: What if a lot of people visit my site at once? Could it slow down? How do I make sure my website loads quickly, no matter where people are in the world? That’s when I found AWS CloudFront.</p>
        <p>CloudFront is a service that helps make websites load faster by storing copies of your website at different locations around the world. When someone visits my website, CloudFront makes sure it loads from the closest location to them. This makes the site faster, no matter how many visitors I have.</p>

        <h3>Storing My Images with Amazon S3</h3>
        <p>Another challenge I faced was how to store all my images. I didn’t want to take up too much space on my computer or worry about losing my files. So, I uploaded all my images to Amazon S3. This way, they’re safely stored in the cloud, and I don’t have to worry about running out of space or managing them manually.</p>

        <h3>Why AWS Changed How I See Web Development</h3>
        <p>Before using AWS, I thought building a website was just about writing good code and designing a great page. But I quickly learned there’s a lot more to it than that. I realized that to keep everything working smoothly—especially when lots of people are visiting your site—you need more than just code. AWS helps make sure everything is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain, which is why I consider it an essential tool for any developer.</p>

        <p>Using AWS has completely changed how I think about web development. I now understand the importance of scalable storage, fast content delivery, and the ability to handle high traffic without breaking a sweat. It’s been an amazing journey, and I’m excited to keep learning and building more with the help of AWS!</p>
